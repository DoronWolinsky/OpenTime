# 🕒 OpenTime – Personal Time Management for Open University Students

## 🎯 Project Goal
OpenTime is a lightweight time management tool designed specifically for students at the Open University. The goal is to help students manage their study time more effectively by organizing courses, assignments, deadlines, and available study hours.

Since Open University students study independently, time planning plays a crucial role in academic success. This app aims to automate and personalize that planning process.
